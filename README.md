### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
The goal of this project was for me to rebuild some of my skills with React and learn Typescript as well.  I wanted to start simpler with a basic todo application, but add complexity over time to make it more of a kanban board with features like drag and drop.
